## Intent
Being able to conduct TDD is one of the key skills developers need these days. It encourages reusable, simple and testable code. This step will introduce TDD into their skillset and prepare them for future steps.

Rather than reinvent the wheel This step is just to complete one or more katas from codingdojo.org. This is fairly quick step and TDD will be applied in the next step. 

After the step is completed: 
- Ask the mentee if they had any difficulties/why
- Get the mentee to take you through their code and ask them to show it working. 

## Program

Fairly good write up on Wikipedia.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

Read up on TDD and complete the bowling Kata with a TDD approach. It is recommended to TDD multiple katas, although the requirement is just the once.
