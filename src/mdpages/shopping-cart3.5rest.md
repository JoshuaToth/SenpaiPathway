Create a rich frontend that will communicate with the REST api you created in the previous step.

- You can choose any frontend framework you want. (Angular/React recommended) 
- If it’s a javascript framework, ensure it has an appropriate build and package system (Npm/Yarn/Gulp/Webpack) 

You can take this step as far as you want.

### Tips:

- This is more about functionality than form. Focus more on the interactions and less on the style of the frontend.  
- Don’t worry about authentication, you can add this as an extension if you want.  
- Start with a tutorial in your given framework. Pluralsight is a good resource for this. Logins are available for Pageup Employees.
