## Task: 

Read up on the SOLID design principles and then re-implement the console app shopping cart, with an extension.

### Extension - Shipping cost. 

Depending on the item weight, there will be several brackets the weight falls into:

Weight Bracket

Cost

0g - 75g: $3.50

76g - 200g: $8

200g - 499g: $15

500g - 999g: $22

1kg - 2.999kg: $35

3kg - 8kg: $50

8kg+: 50 + $5/kg over 8kg

Calculate the shipping cost and add that to the total.
