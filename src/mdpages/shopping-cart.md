The user inputs several shopping items and quantities. The program returns a total cost.

Items can be discounted (‘on special’) by either a percentage or a flat amount. 
If the item is discounted in both ways, the item will receive the higher discount of the two.
At least one item should be discounted. 
(i.e. a $5.04 item is discounted by 10% or $3, it will be discounted by $3 to a total of $2)
(i.e. a $4.64 item is discounted by 50% or $1, it will be discounted by $2.32)

The user can use a coupon code to discount all items by a percentage.
If the item already has a discount, the higher discount will be used.
(i.e. a $5 item is discounted by 10% or $3 and the user uses a coupon code discounting 50%, the item will still use the higher $3 discount)

The user can use a coupon code to discount a type of item by a percentage.
(i.e all vegetables by 3%). 
Same rules as above apply.

The user can only use one coupon. 

Try to have at least 10 items available, some of similar types.
Try to have a combination of percentage and flat ‘specials’
