We landed on a custom program which is loosely defined enough to allow for some freedom in the end solution. The solution is intentionally left feeling incomplete until later steps. This is to encourage new methods to be applied rather than just refactoring. </p>\n<p>The program currently consists of about 8 ish steps. Each step after the first including an assessment and reflection between pupil and mentor. Each step will be accompanied by an intent and expectation that you, the mentor should be aware of before handing out the step and during the reflection period.</p>\n<p>It is highly recommended to attempt the entire solution yourself, although that is up to you.</p>\n<p>Freedom of technology is encouraged. When originally writing this solution it was for .Net but the problem can be applied to multiple languages and paradigms. Whatever suits you. </p>\n<p>In order to keep your pupils focused, it\'s recommended to send a copy of the problem statement (and to tailor it if needed) to them, rather than a link to this site. This avoids them reading too much into the mentor notes. </p>\n<p>Pairing is allowed and some pupils may require it.</p>\n<h2><a href="../shopping">> The Shopping Cart Problem: Begin &#x3C;</a></h2>\n<p>Step index:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="../shopping">Shopping Cart</a></li>\n<li><a href="../shopping2">Shopping Cart 2: S.O.L.I.D</a></li>\n<li><a href="../TDD">Test Driven Development: Kata</a></li>\n<li><a href="../shopping3">Shopping Cart 3: REST</a></li>\n<li><a href="../shopping3_5">Shopping Cart 3.5: REST + JS</a></li>\n<li><a href="../shopping4">Shopping Cart 4: CQRS</a></li>\n<li><a href="../shopping5">Shopping Cart 5: Distributed</a></li>\n<li><a href="../shopping6">Shopping Cart 6: Eventing</a></li>\n</ul>',frontmatter:{path:"/developers",title:"Developers: The shopping cart problem."}}},pathContext:{}}}});
